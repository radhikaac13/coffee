        <h2 id="d8">Whats Coffee...???</h2><br>
        <p id="p1"><strong>Everyone</strong> recognizes a roasted coffee bean, but you might not recognize an actual
            coffee plant.

            White flowers on coffee tree
            Coffee trees are pruned short to conserve their energy and aid in harvesting, but can grow to more than 30
            feet (9 meters) high. Each tree is covered with green, waxy leaves growing opposite each other in pairs.
            Coffee cherries grow along the branches. Because it grows in a continuous cycle, it’s not unusual to see
            flowers, green fruit and ripe fruit simultaneously on a single tree.

            It takes nearly a year for a cherry to mature after first flowering, and about 5 years of growth to reach
            full fruit production. While coffee plants can live up to 100 years, they are generally the most productive
            between the ages of 7 and 20. Proper care can maintain and even increase their output over the years,
            depending on the variety. The average coffee tree produces 10 pounds of coffee cherry per year, or 2 pounds
            of green beans.

            All commercially grown coffee is from a region of the world called the Coffee Belt. The trees grow best in
            rich soil, with mild temperatures, frequent rain and shaded sun.</p>

        <h1 id="d5">Coffee Bean Varieties And Types</h1>
        <p id="p2"><strong>Coffee beans vary in their size, shape, color, and flavor depending on the region and
                conditions in which they were grown. The range of unique flavors and aromas between regional varietals
                is as expansive as the variety of wine available from different vineyards. It is well worth
                experimenting with different varietals to discover a bean perfect for your palate.

                Most regional varietals will fall into two main categories, Robusta or Arabica.</strong></p>

        <div id="d6">
            <h2 id="d7">ARABICA</h2>
            <p id="p3">Arabica coffee is considered superior to Robusta because of its delicate flavor and low acidity.
                This
                variety is grown at higher altitudes and can be more difficult and costly to grow. These
                labor-intensive,
                low-yield plants produce a high-demand bean that sells for a higher price.</p>

        <div id="d9">
            <h2 id="d10">ROBUSTA</h2>
            <p id="p4">Robusta coffee tends to have a more acidic and harsh flavor than Arabica as well as higher levels
                of
                caffeine. Robusta can be grown at lower altitudes, in hotter climates, and with less moisture. Since
                Robusta
                has fewer growing restrictions and has a generally less desirable flavor. </p>
